    *   **End Users (终端用户):** People who use computers to make themselves more productive.
    *   Contact can be **direct** (hands-on use)(这指的是你亲自、直接地操作计算机硬件和软件。你是那个坐在电脑前，使用键盘、鼠标、触摸屏等设备与计算机进行互动的人。) or **indirect** (using the results from a computer, like a bill).(这指的是你没有亲自操作某台计算机，但你使用了由那台计算机处理后产生的信息、产品或服务。)

2.  **Procedures (规程)**
    *   The rules or guidelines for people to follow when using software, hardware, and data.
    *   Typically documented in manuals(说明书), which are provided by software and hardware manufacturers（制造商） in either **printed (印刷)** or **electronic (电子)** form.

3.  **Software (软件)**
    *   Another name for a **program (程序)**.
    *   A program consists of step-by-step instructions that tell the computer how to do its work.
    *   The purpose of software is to convert **data (数据)** into **information (信息)**.（把原始、零散、没有特定意义的“数据”，通过处理、组织和分析，转变成有意义、有条理、能帮助我们理解事物或做出决策的“信息”）

    *   There are two major types of software:

    *   Key components（组成部分） include the system unit, input/output devices, secondary storage, and communication devices.（一台个人计算机的关键硬件部件，可以分为四个主要类别：系统单元、输入/输出设备、辅助存储设备和通信设备。）

5.  **Data (数据)**
    *   Raw, unprocessed facts, including text, numbers, images, and sounds.
    *   Data is processed by the computer to create useful **information (信息)**.
    *   Stored electronically in files. Common types include:

#### **3. Detailed Look at Software (软件详解)**

##### **A. System Software (系统软件)**
*   "Background" software（系统软件是幕后软件） that enables application software to interact with computer hardware.
*   It helps the computer manage its own internal（体内的） resources.
*   It is a collection（堆） of programs, including:
    1.  **Operating Systems (OS - 操作系统)**
        *   Coordinates（协调） computer resources, prProvides an interface(界面) between users and the computer and runs applications.
        *   **Three types of OS:**
            *   **Embedded OS (嵌入式操作系统):** Used by smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. Includes **RTOS (Real-time operating systems - 实时操作系统)**.
            *   **Standalone OS (独立操作系统):** Used by desktop computers (e.g., Windows, macOS).
            *   **Network OS (NOS - 网络操作系统):** Used to run and manage networks.
    2.  **Utilities (实用程序)**
        *   Perform specific tasks related to managing computer resources.
        *   An **antivirus program (杀毒软件)** is one of the most essential utility programs.

##### **B. Application Software (应用软件)**
*   "End-user" software designed to accomplish a variety of tasks.
*   **Three types:**
    1.  **General-Purpose Applications (通用应用程序):** Widely used programs like browsers, word processors（文字处理软件，比如Microsoft Word）, spreadsheets（电子表格软件，比如Microsoft Excel）, and presentation graphics（演示图形软件，比如Microsoft PowerPoint）.它们不是为某个特定的、专业的行业或任务设计的，而是可以被几乎所有人（学生、办公室职员、家庭用户等）用来完成各种日常的、常见的计算机任务。
    2.  **Specialized Applications (专业应用程序):** Programs that are more narrowly focused, such as graphics（图形软件，） and web authoring programs（网页制作软件，Visual Studio Code 可以用来网页开发）.
    3.  **Mobile Apps (移动应用):** Applications designed for mobile devices for social networking, playing games, downloading music, etc.

#### **4. Detailed Look at Hardware (硬件详解)**

##### **A. Four Types of Computers (四种类型的计算机)**

1.  **Supercomputers (超级计算机)**
    *   The most powerful and fastest type of computer.
    *   Special high-capacity（高容量） computers used by very large organizations for complex calculations (e.g., scientific research, weather forecasting).
    *   Example: **Sunway TaihuLight (神威-太湖之光)**, developed in China, with over 10 million processor cores.

2.  **Mainframe Computers (大型机)**
    *   Not as powerful as supercomputers but capable of great processing speeds and data storage.
    *   Used by large corporations (e.g., banks, insurance companies) to process large amounts of data.
    *   Known for high **reliability (可靠性)**, **security (安全性)**, and efficient I/O (input/output) performance.

3.  **Midrange Computers (中型计算机)**
    *   Also referred to as **servers (服务器)** or **minicomputers (小型机)**.
    *   Less powerful than a mainframe but more powerful than a personal computer.
    *   They serve end-users for specific needs, such as retrieving data（检索数据） from a database or providing access to applications over a network.

4.  **Personal Computers (PC - 个人计算机)**
    *   The least powerful but most widely used and fastest-growing type of computer.
    *   **Five types of PCs:**

*   **Three things driving the impact of technology (三大技术驱动力):**
    1.  **Cloud Computing (云计算)**
        *   Uses the Internet to shift computer activities from a user's local computer to computers on the Internet.
        *   It is a business model that provides on-demand access to a shared pool of computing resources (e.g., storage, servers, applications).
        *   **Benefit:** Reduces costs for companies as they can rent hardware and services instead of buying and maintaining their own.

    2.  **Wireless Communication (无线通信)**
        *   Has changed the way we communicate, primarily through devices like tablets, smartphones, and wearables.

    3.  **The Internet of Things (IoT - 物联网)**
        *   The continuing development of the Internet that allows all types of devices to communicate with each other.
        *   It is an extension of the Internet, connecting not just people, but also machines and objects (**人、机、物**), to enable communication at any time from any place.
        *   **Internet vs. IoT:** The Internet connects **users (用户)**, while the IoT connects **things (物品)**.
